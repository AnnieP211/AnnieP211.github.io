This project explored how immersive virtual reality (VR) environments can be used as effective educational tools by transforming traditional learning experiences into interactive, game-based systems. Working with XRIO and Kapiʻolani Community College, I designed and built a series of VR worlds using Meta Horizon Worlds that incorporated puzzles, challenges, reward systems, and progression mechanics to support learning objectives. The project drew on research in game-based learning and gamification, focusing on how elements such as feedback loops, scoring systems, collaboration, and adaptive challenges can increase student engagement and retention. The end result was a set of playable VR environments that demonstrated how educational content can be embedded into interactive gameplay rather than delivered through static textbooks or lectures.

My role in this project involved both technical development and design iteration. I was responsible for building custom worlds from scratch in Meta Horizon Worlds, writing and modifying TypeScript-based scripts to control gameplay logic, player interactions, scoring systems, object behavior, and event triggers. I developed multiple tutorial-based environments, beginning with foundational mechanics such as movement, collision detection, and object interaction, and progressing toward more complex features including rotating puzzle objects, dynamic UI feedback, cross-platform considerations, camera and HUD adaptations, and custom interaction scripts (such as color-changing and number-revealing mechanics). I also designed the layout, flow, and visual structure of each world, incorporating audio, lighting, and environmental props to enhance immersion. Throughout the project, I iteratively tested and refined each world based on player experience and usability.

Through this experience, I gained hands-on skills in VR development, scripting, and interactive system design, as well as a deeper understanding of how game mechanics can support learning outcomes. I learned how to break down complex systems into modular components, design logic-driven interactions, and debug behavior in a real-time 3D environment. Beyond technical skills, the project strengthened my ability to think critically about user experience, accessibility, and engagement in educational technology. It also reinforced the importance of iterative design, experimentation, and reflection when building interactive systems. Overall, this project helped me connect computer science concepts with real-world applications in education, and it shaped my interest in using immersive technology to create meaningful, learner-centered digital experiences.
