My interest in software engineering is still developing, but it has been 
shaped by hands-on projects that have shown me how complex and thoughtful 
the field really is. Rather than feeling confident in any one specialty, I 
am motivated by curiosity and a desire to better understand how software 
systems are designed, maintained, and improved over time. Through coursework 
and collaborative projects, I have begun to see that software engineering is 
not just about making code run, but about making design decisions that 
affect clarity, usability, and long-term sustainability. These experiences 
have helped me appreciate how much there is still to learn, which is what 
continues to draw me to the field.

Many of the projects I have worked on so far have taught me more about the 
process of software engineering than about mastery of specific tools. I have 
learned how to read unfamiliar code, test behavior, identify edge cases, and 
think about how individual components fit into a larger system. In group 
settings, I often take on roles involving review, integration, and feedback, 
which has helped me recognize the importance of communication and iteration 
in technical work. These experiences have shown me that good software often 
comes from careful revision and collaboration, not just from writing code 
quickly.

Looking ahead, I hope to continue building a stronger foundation in core 
software engineering concepts such as system design, data handling, and 
problem decomposition. I am especially interested in gaining more experience 
with real-world applications, where constraints, users, and incomplete 
information make problems more challenging and meaningful. I also want to 
develop better habits around debugging, documentation, and asking effective 
technical questions, as these skills seem just as important as writing code 
itself.

Overall, I see my current position as a computer science student and learner 
rather than an expert. I am intentionally open to exploring different areas 
within computer science, using my general degree as an opportunity to learn 
broadly before narrowing my focus. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to 
building systems that are technically sound, purposeful, and thoughtfully 
designed, while learning to navigate the gray area where something can be a 
bug to a tester, a feature to a developer, and a design decision waiting to 
be improved.
